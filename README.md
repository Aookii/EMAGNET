#### Removed all email addresses.
![Screenshot](https://nr1.nu/f/ucdb.png)

Emagnet is a very powerful tool for it's purpose wich is to capture email addresses and passwords from leaked databases uploaded on pastebin. It's almost impossible to find leaked passwords when they are out of list on pastebin.com. Either they have been deleted by pastebin's techs or the uploads is just one in the crowd. To be honest it's easier to find a needle in a haystack then find outdated uploads on pastebin with the data we want to collect. 

#### Previews for all Emagnet features can be found [here](https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET/wiki/Previews)

#### BBC NEWS: ["Pastebin: Running the site where hackers publicise their attacks"](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17524822)

### Notice

Attacking different kinds of accounts via emagnet that you have not been granted or allowed to attack is strictly prohibited and it breaks the law. The punishment is hard and you can even get into prison in some countries just for trying to attack for intrusion. With this said, it's *important* that all users is aware of this and when you have cloned or downloaded it's fully up to every user to take responsibility over their own actions. wuseman cannot be held responsible for the actions of any user, all users using Emagnet on their own responsibility. 

Developer: "All my previews where a brute force attack has been done is under controlling forms with 100% fully permissions by the owners. If you have any questions about this then you are welcome to contact me or the owner."

### Haters Gonna Hate

If you are one of these who dislikes _EMAGNET_ and believe the program has been developed for a reason that would break the law then I am not interested in taking part of your opinions, keep them for _yourself_! Emagnet does **NOT** leak any data at all either to the developer(s) or anyone else. No statistics at all to track any user so if you want to contact me for ask who it might was who downloaded emagnet a specific date is completely useless since i really have no idea, and to be honest I don't care.

Feel free to read the history about emagnet [here](https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET/wiki/About) and how everything started about this project.

#### Development of emagnet is active and is updated frequently, please use the latest version if you report issues/bugs.

### Emagnet is a private project since 2015 and was released in June @ 2018, to be continued.
