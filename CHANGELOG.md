-    Merged everything into emagnet (emagnet-f.sh) will call emagnet if you run emagnet -f
-    Parallel has been added to this version for ALOT faster downloads, it is required to have parallel installed. You will be asked to install parallel if you miss the package.Ì£
-    Fixed a small bug that did so files never moved from .temp path if there was an email found so it repeated that X mail addresses had been found.
-    Haveibeenpwned checker has been removed since it's useless cause we got banned all the time via emagnet

-    Added comments to all functions so it's easier for people who want to improve/edit/reconfigure emagnet
-    Small layout changes.
-    Changed question emagnet used if you got banned and wanted to read the message for idle in 1200 seconds instead and then we start again, you can leave emagnet running 24/7 now it will handle everything perfect, you can change idle time if you want in /etc/emagnet.conf but remember pastebin use 20 minutes until they remove the temp ban if you wasn't PERMANENT banned (you must have been abusing pastebin VERY much for get permanent banned)

##### Version 1.5.1

-    Added idle time setting to conf file, this setting is for how long you want to stay idle if emagnet have noticed a ip ban from pastebin

##### Version 1.5

-   Some small fixes has been solved with setup script
-   emagnet-wbruter has been added as a new feature, consider this as a beta since this is still under active development

##### Version 1.4

-   I decided to split everything into small scripts instead since it's alot easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong, you wont notice any difference at all, run 'emagnet' to execute them, 
    there is no  reason to run any of the scripts from .scripts dir, listing the new ones only:
    .scripts/emagnet-backup.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-banner.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-clone.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-f.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-help.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-hidden.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-main.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-mirror.sh
    .scirpts/emagnet-ping.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-requirements.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-spider.sh

-   Added .scripts/emagnet-ping.sh - Enter a dns and emagnet will check via downforjustyou website if host is up
    and for ipv4 number ip addressed emagnet gonna use '/bin/ping' instead for get a valid result very very fast if the ip-address is up or down.
-   It's now possible to use emagnet for upload from stdout from commandline, example usage: 'dmesg | emagnet -n'. Host does NOT store any ip number or other data about users at all.
-   Silent mode, download all urls and store them in background, you can go cook a cup of coffe instead! 
-   Small fixes
-   Mirror any website and download everything that is possible from the website(try mirror facebook, (EXTREMELY MUCH DATA =))
-   Gather all urls from a webpage, this is meant to be a web crawler.
-   It's now possible to clone all repos from any user on github.

##### Version 1.3

-   Emagnet will notice if you getting ip-banned from pastebin and then emagnet will stop and after X minutes emagnet will continue.
-   Small fixes
-   .scripts/emagnet-f.sh is a loop script, there i no reason for touch this, run emagnet -f to execute it.
-   Now execute setup.sh to setup everything before you will run emagnet. There is no requirements for edit 
    /etc/emagnet.conf anymore, just run emagnet-setup.sh and then you will be able to run emagnet.
-   Debug mode has been enable, use debug mode with arg: -d 

##### Version: 1.2

-   Fixed so we wont keep any duplicate.
-   Set your paths in /etc/emagnet.conf. There is no need for change stuff in 'emagnet' anymore.
-   Now emagnet store all files from pastebin so you can go through them later if you wanna find something offline without any stress..
-   More efficient logging to keep things sorted, all uploaded files that includes email addresses will be stored in it's own folder so it's easy to find passwords and mail addresses.
-   Added getopts, from now you must use -o, -h or -f to run emagnet.
-   Help section was added.
-   Paths need to be properly set in /etc/magnet.conf otherwise emagnet wont run (no more files in emagnet folder ;))
-   If pastebin has banned the current IP beccause you was an idiot and was trying to fetch uploads every <10s then emagnet will stop (just change ip)
-   Mirror any site and download all files that is possible from a website
